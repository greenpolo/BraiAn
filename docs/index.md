# BraiAn documentation

BraiAn is a collection of two toolkits for whole-**brai**n quantitative **an**alysis of large datasets.
Specifically, it was first designed for studying brain activity in behavioural groups through immediate early genes and imaging (see _TODO:CIT_).\
This site contains the project documentation for both its modules:

* [_BraiAn for QuPath_](braian-qupath.md), an extension for image analysis; and
* [`braian`](braian-python.md), a Python library for data check, analysis and visualisation.

YSK: BraiAn's names stands for _**Brai**n **An**alysis_.\
I suggest you to listen to "[Brianstorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianstorm)" by Arctic Monkey while working with BraiAn ;)

## Contributing

We decided to publish the BraiAn pipeline with the most libre licence possible because we find maximum value in learning from others
and sharing our own—small—knowledge.

We, developers in neuroscience, are islands that often work alone and frequently end up reinventing the wheel rather then spending time finding, pickup up and adapting the work that somebody, from the other side of the world, did with no intention to publish. For this reason we spent a great amount of our personal time making the modules as usable, extensible, and long-lasting as we could. And yet, we know it could be better, that there could be bugs, unforeseen scenarios and missing features.

For this reason we hope that, _if you find our work useful_, you will find time and will to contribute back upstream with issues, PRs, documentation, tests, feature requests... _Any_ activity makes us happy!\
