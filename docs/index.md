# BraiAn documentation

BraiAn is a collection of two toolkits for whole-**brai**n quantitative **an**alysis of large datasets.
Specifically, it was first designed for studying brain activity in behavioural groups through immediate early genes and imaging (see _TODO:CIT_).\
This site contains the project documentation for both its modules:

* [_BraiAn for QuPath_](braian-qupath.md), an extension for image analysis; and
* [`braian`](braian-python.md), a Python library for data check, analysis and visualisation.

YSK: BraiAn's names stands for _**Brai**n **An**alysis_.\
I suggest you to listen to "[Brianstorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianstorm)" by Arctic Monkey while working with BraiAn ;)

## Contributing

I decided to publish the BraiAn pipeline (i.e. this QuPath extension and the subsequent [python library](https://codeberg.org/SilvaLab/BraiAn)) with the most libre licence possible because I find maximum value in learning from others
and sharing my own—small—knowledge.

We, developers in neuroscience, are islands that often work alone and frequently end up reinventing the wheel rather then spending time finding, pickup up and adapting the work that somebody on the other side of the world did with no intention to publish. For this reason I spent a great amount of my personal time making this extension as usable, extensible, and long-lasting as I could. And yet, I know it could be better, that there could be bugs, unforeseen scenarios and missing features.

For this reason I hope that if you find my work useful, you will find time and will to contribute back upstream with
issues, PRs, documentation, tests, feature requests... _Any_ activity makes me happy!
